# Final Project In Machine Learning
Oz Pinto

# Graphical Part:
This part is about plotting with the matplotlib and seaborn libraries respectively.
Given a dataset containing data about the Apple App Store,
the task we were required to do was to visualize various graphs,
from which we can comfortably infer conclusions about the data.

# Private Database Part:
This part revolves around supervised learning algorithms and implementing them on
datasets chosen from kaggle.com.
My chosen dataset was an all time video game sale registry, containing a large collection
of games both stunningly successful(in terms of global sale numbers) and large failures(low sales).

The Features I used for the prediction were:
1.NA_Sales - number of sales in North America in millions of units. 
2.JP_Sales - number of sales in Japan in millions of units.
3.EU_Sales - number of sales in Europe in millions of units.
4.Global_Sales - number of sales worldwide in millions of units.
